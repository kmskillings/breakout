## Background

In winter of 2023, I took the Reconfigurable Computing class at Utah State
University. The final project of the class was an implementation of the video
game Breakout, targetting the DE10-Lite development board.

After I completed this project, I continued to gain experience with FPGA. This
project will apply the lessons I've learned since 2023 to create a cleaner,
more feature-rich version of the game.
